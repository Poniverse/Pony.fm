<h1>Pony.fm FAQ</h1>
<div class="stretch-to-bottom">
    <h2>Why doesn't Pony.fm support MP3 uploads?</h2>

    <p>MP3 encoding is "lossy." Lossy means that, during the encoding
        process, quality gets sacrificed for a decrease in size.</p>

    <p>Pony.fm accepts lossless uploads, which put a "perfect" copy of
        your track in Pony.fm's file store. This is offered up for
        download on its own for audiophiles who like CD or better-than-CD
        sound quality, but starting from a lossless original also allows
        Pony.fm to transcode a song to other lossy formats with only one
        degree of loss.</p>


    <h2>Why isn't my file being accepted for upload?</h2>

    <p>Pony.fm analyzes all uploads to determine their format and check it
        against a whitelist; the file extension is ignored. Unfortunately,
        slight variations in AIFF and WAV files exist that need to be
        individually whitelisted.</p>

    <p>Most of these should have been nailed by now, but if yours isn't being
        accepted, contact <a href="mailto:mercury@poniverse.net" target="_blank">mercury@poniverse.net/a> or <a href="mailto:support@pony.fm" target="_blank">Pony.fm Support</a>
        with
        a
        copy of the file you&#39;re trying to upload and we&#39;ll sort it out!
    </p>


    <h2>How do I upload a song?</h2>

    <p>At the top right of your screen there should be a button titled
        "Upload" next to the "send feedback" one. Select the Upload button
        and a drop down menu will appear, select the first option titled
        "Track Uploader". You should now be on a screen displaying the
        uploader. Select the Green button titled "Add Files" and select your
        song from your computer. The track should now start its
        download.</p>

    <p>Please be aware that Pony.fm doesn't support MP3 uploads.</p>


    <h2>How do I set an avatar?</h2>

    <p>Avatars in Pony.fm use a free service called Gravatar. To learn more and
        set up your own Gravatar account, <a
            href="https://gravatar.com/" title="Gravatar" target="_blank">click
            here</a>!</p>

    <h2>Why the connection to MLP Forums?</h2>

    <p>MLP Forums is the web&#39;s largest <em>My
        Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</em> forum community. Formally
        linking the two sites together paves the way for a rich, cross-site
        community experience. Members of one site can easily jump into the
        other without the hassle of managing yet another account, and
        content can seamlessly be brought from MLP Forums to Pony.fm and
        vice versa in meaningful ways.</p>


    <h2>How do I send feedback to the developers?</h2>

    <p>Three ways! Choose whichever you're most comfortable with:</p>

    <ul>
