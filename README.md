Contributing

If you've run across a bug or have a feature request,
[open an issue](https://github.com/Poniverse/Pony.fm/issues/new)
for it.

For general questions and discussions about the site, stop by at
the [Pony.fm forum](https://mlpforums.com/forum/62-ponyfm/).

For quick fixes, go ahead and submit a pull request!

For larger features, it's best to open an issue before sinking a ton of work
into building them, to coordinate with Pony.fm's maintainers.

Developer documentation is available in the [`documentation` directory](documentation).

**Protip:** Looking for a place to jump in and start coding? Try a
[quickwin issue](https://github.com/Poniverse/Pony.fm/labels/quickwin%21) -
these are smaller in scope and easier to tackle if you're unfamiliar with the codebase!


Starting a dev environment
==========================

To begin development, do the following:

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and
   [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) if you don't have them already.

2. Install the `vagrant-hostmanager` plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`

3. Install the `vagrant-bindfs` plugin: `vagrant plugin install vagrant-bindfs`

4. Run `vagrant up` from the folder in which you cloned the repository

5. Run `vagrant ssh`, `cd /vagrant`, and `php artisan poni:setup`.

6. Follow the instructions in the "Asset pipeline" section below to set that up.

Once everything is up and running, you'll be able to access the site at [http://ponyfm-dev.poni/](http://ponyfm-dev.poni/). You can access the MySQL database by logging into **ponyfm-dev.poni:3306** with the username **homestead** and the password **secret**. Pony.fm's database is named **homestead**.

Asset pipeline
--------------

Pony.fm uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to mange its asset pipeline.

**Important:** Run `npm` and `gulp` from your host machine and not within the VM. You must first have it installed globally:

    npm install -g gulp

And then install all of the required local packages by invoking:

    npm install

Finally, to compile and serve the assets in real time, run the following (and leave it running while you develop):

    gulp watch

Configuring the servers
-----------------------

Pony.fm uses nginx, php-fpm, redis, and MySQL. You can modify the configuration of these services by locating the appropriate config file in the `vagrant` folder. Once modified, you must reload the configuration by running the appropriate shell script (`reload-config.sh`) or bat files (`reload-config.bat` and `reload-config.vmware.bat`). These scripts simply tell Vagrant to run `copy-and-restart-config.sh` on the VM.

If you need to change any other configuration file on the VM - copy the entire file over into the vagrant folder, make your changes, and update the `copy-and-restart-config.sh` script to copy the modified config back into the proper folder. All potential configuration requirements should be represented in the `vagrant` folder **and never only on the VM itself** as changes will not be preserved.
